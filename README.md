- 👋 Hi, I’m @luislopezbracey and I’m a lead data analyst.
- 👀 I've played around with analytics for the last 6 years, before which I was a management consultant. I hold an MBA and a Master's in Engineering.
- 💞️ I launched my own charity venture that uses data to match disadvantaged students with tutors.
- 🌱 When I am not coding you can find me scrapping Skyscanner for my next adventure. I also spend a lot of my time playing sports -- any (sport != NULL)
